# va-court-scraper
Scrapes the VA circuit court database.

Created for a UVa student's Global Security and Justice thesis paper. Automatically scrapes [Virginia's circuit court databases](http://ewsocis1.courts.state.va.us/CJISWeb/circuit.jsp) with supplied dates and pulls relevant data. 

Utilizes Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

## TODO
- Ability to easily change which circuit court is selected. Selected through index position currently.
- Ability to crawl through more than the first page, per date.
- Move some repetitive functions into their own functions
- Just clean it up...
